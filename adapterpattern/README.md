Adapter Pattern
Simply a bridge btw the existing interface vs expected interface

TextBook Defination:
Adapter Design Pattern is a structural pattern that acts as a bridge between two incompatible interfaces, allowing them to work together. 
It is especially useful for integrating legacy code or third-party libraries into a new system.
